This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving raw pointers and vector reallocations.  Modifying a vector's data via a raw pointer after the vector's internal memory has been reallocated (e.g., due to pushing/popping elements or resizing) results in undefined behavior. The example showcases this issue and its solution.  Understanding this is critical for writing safe and reliable Rust code that interacts with low-level memory management.
